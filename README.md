It's only a Pong Game....right?
Well, how about we make its cooperative? But here's the deal, we slap a rhythm game on top of it to make is spicy!
Survive.

<h2>About Game</h2>
RhythmPong coop is a cooperative game where 2 players play Pong and try to juggle the ball on the screen, while at the same time play a rhythm game where they have to play the note in time.
Each time passes, the ball increases it's speed. Decrease it's speed by hitting the note, the more it's in time the more the ball speed decreases. The players have 3 lives. They lose their life if the ball
get off from the screen. The players win if they survive until the end of the song.

<h2>Mechanics</h2>

The players have to hit the note in time. The more in time it is, the more score the players got and the more the ball slows down. There's also an indicator showing how in time the note hit is;
Bad, Mid, Good, and Perfect.

<h3>Score</h3>
When the game ends, either by winning or losing, the players will be shown total score from many aspects of the game including note hit time, lives remaining and win or losing.
